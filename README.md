# Analytics-projects-in-python

## What is this repository about
When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other and help each other to improve the coding skills. I put some analytic projects that I have done by using Python in this file, I will love to see how people put their opinion on it and also you can feel free to take some of my codes as the reference in your works.

## Introduction

This repository contains data analysis projects that demonstrates the complete data analysis process from data collection to insights drawn and presenting the recommendations in the form of visualisations. The project aims to provide insights into real-world problems and solve them using data analysis techniques.

The goal was to understand the basic ways to analyze business datasets, understand real world scenarios and draw preliminary conclusions that would pave the way for more extensive Exploratory Data Analysis. The data has been cleaned, preprocessed and analyzed to obtain insights.

# Asset Management Company Data Analysis
The dataset is used to analyze variables that are likely to influence the business across verticals like Banking and Asset Management Companies using basic python concepts of for-loops and user-defined functions along with data manipulation and visualization techniques using Pandas and NumPy libraries. The objective was to identify the best countries and a suitable investment type for making the investment for a firm. The overall strategy was to invest where others are investing, implying that the best countries are the ones ‚Äòwhere most investors are investing‚Äô.
